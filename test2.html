  <div class="col"> <h3>What is so special about The Green House and how do you build using circular building principles? We asked architect Jaap Bosch from Cepezed Architects. </h3></div>

   <h4> What was the assignment? </h4>
    <p> The Green House was part of the assignment we received for an adjacent state office building. This area will be constructed in three phases. In the first phase, the old barracks will be renovated into a state office and conference centre. We were asked to figure out how to make the area surrounding the barracks lively for the next fifteen years until the final phase of construction starts.
      That is how the idea arose to make a circular building that could be taken apart into pieces and rebuild somewhere else. The building has a café on the ground floor and conference rooms on the first floor. It’s located on a prominent intersection in the city, and in that sense, it seemed logical to add some liveliness on that location. </p>
      <h4>How did you make the architectural design for The Green House? </h4>
      <p>Actually, there were only a few conditions that needed to be met. It had to be somewhere between two hundred and three thousand square metres big and fit within the timeframe of phase three construction. That’s what made it a lot of fun, we were free to decide what we wanted to with the design. </p>
     <h4> What do you have to take into account when constructing a sustainable circular building? </h4>
      
      <p>First, it is vital that you build something that can be taken apart. A classical foundation and ground floor with poured concrete is difficult to remove so we used prefabricated concrete blocks for the foundation. You also would not want to mason the walls or pour concrete walls. For the Green House, we chose for a steel frame with bolted joints so we could assemble it on-site.
      
      We also had to figure something out for the facade. We again used the idea of using loose elements. Loose wooden parts form the facade, similar to what we did with the glass facade. We also tried to minimise the use of sealant for the glass facade.</p></div>
